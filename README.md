# Task 10 - Python EDA & Outlier Detection

This repository contains the solution for Task 10 of my Data Analyst Internship, which focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Outlier Detection using Python.

Dataset Used:
House Price India Dataset

---

## Objectives
- Load and explore the dataset
- Generate descriptive statistics
- Analyze missing values
- Visualize data distributions
- Detect outliers using IQR method
- Create outlier flag column
- Handle outliers using capping
- Generate correlation matrix
- Export cleaned dataset
